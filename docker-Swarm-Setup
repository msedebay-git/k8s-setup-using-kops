  Docker Swarm Setup
                                                       ================

Rerequisites:
============

3 - Ubuntu Servers
     1 - Master
    2 - Workers
   
Steps:
======
         
1) Install Docker Community Edition in all the 3 Servers.
   And add user(ubuntu) to docker group.
                
   # Below command works for most of the Linux flavors except Redhat Linux
   sudo curl -fsSL get.docker.com | /bin/bash
  
   # Add Current User to docker group.
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
  
2) Open below ports in AWS Security Groups.
      
    TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
    TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
    UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic.
   
    If you are planning on creating an overlay network with encryption     (--opt encrypted), you will  also need     to ensure ip protocol 50 (ESP) traffic is allowed.
     
3) Execute below command to initiate docker swarm manager in one system.
  
   # Initialize docker swarm cluster.
   docker swarm init
  
   # Get worker token
   docker swarm join-token worker
  
   # Get manager token to add another node as secondary manager
   docker swarm join-token manager
  
4) Add workers machines to cluster.
   #Execute join token(worker token from manager) in all worker machines.
  
  
5) Display docker cluster nodes in manager machine.

   docker node ls
  
6) Deploy Sample Docker Application in docker swarm cluster.

    docker service create --name webserver --replicas 2 -p 80:80 httpd
